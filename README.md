# continuous_control_RL

To set up your Python environment, go here: https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies

To download the Unity Environment, follow the steps here: https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control

The observation space has 33 variables, which describe the position,rotation and other details of the arms position in time/space. 

The action space is a vector of 4 numbers, which describe the forces to apply to two arm joints. Each value in this vector is between -1 and 1.

We consider the environment solved if a reward of 100 is attained for 30 consecutive episodes.

Once your Python and Unity environments are set up, to run the code, just run the jupyter notebook from scratch. Everything can be run directly from the jupyter notebook.
